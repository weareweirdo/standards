# WEIRDO Coding Guidelines

A good styleguide, when well followed, will set the standard for code quality across a codebase, promote consistency across codebases, give people a feeling of familiarity across codebases & increasing productivity.

Styleguides should be learned, understood, and implemented at all times on a project which is governed by one, and any deviation must be fully justified.

## General guidelines
- Use two spaces for indentation.
- Turn on [invisibles](https://www.google.com/search?q=turn+on+invisibles+[EDITOR]) in your editor of choice. It will blow your mind if you don't have it yet.
- Turn on [EditorConfig](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=editorconfig+%5BEDITOR%5D&gws_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=FuopWpI4hsTSBJeQhpAD) in your editor of choice.
- Let your code breathe. Nothing feels more untidy, cramped, and claustrophobic than opening a file with a complete lack of whitespace.
- Delete your [trailing whitespace](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/121555/why-is-trailing-whitespace-a-big-deal).
