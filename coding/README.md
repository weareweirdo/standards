# WEIRDO Coding Guidelines

A coding styleguide (note, not a visual styleguide) is a valuable tool for teams who

build and maintain products for a reasonable length of time;
have developers of differing abilities and specialisms;
have a number of different developers working on a product at any given time;
on-board new staff regularly;
have a number of codebases that developers dip in and out of.
Whilst styleguides are typically more suited to product teams—large codebases on long-lived and evolving projects, with multiple developers contributing over prolonged periods of time—all developers should strive for a degree of standardisation in their code.

A good styleguide, when well followed, will

set the standard for code quality across a codebase;
promote consistency across codebases;
give developers a feeling of familiarity across codebases;
increase productivity.
Styleguides should be learned, understood, and implemented at all times on a project which is governed by one, and any deviation must be fully justified.

## General guidelines
- Use two spaces for indentation.
- Turn on [invisibles](https://www.google.com/search?q=turn+on+invisibles+[EDITOR]) in your editor of choice. It will blow your mind if you don't have it yet.
- Turn on [EditorConfig](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=editorconfig+%5BEDITOR%5D&gws_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=FuopWpI4hsTSBJeQhpAD) in your editor of choice.
- Let your code breathe. Nothing feels more untidy, cramped, and claustrophobic than opening a file with a complete lack of whitespace.
- Delete your [trailing whitespace](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/121555/why-is-trailing-whitespace-a-big-deal).
