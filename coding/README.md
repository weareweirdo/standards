# WEIRDO Coding Guidelines

*"It's not a bug. It's a feature"*

*"Life would be much easier if I had the source code*

## General guidelines
- Use two spaces for indentation.
- Turn on [invisibles](https://www.google.com/search?q=turn+on+invisibles+[EDITOR]) in your editor of choice. It will blow your mind if you don't have it yet.
- Turn on [EditorConfig](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=editorconfig+%5BEDITOR%5D&gws_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=FuopWpI4hsTSBJeQhpAD) in your editor of choice.
- Let your code breathe. Nothing feels more untidy, cramped, and claustrophobic than opening a file with a complete lack of whitespace.
- Delete your [trailing whitespace](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/121555/why-is-trailing-whitespace-a-big-deal).
